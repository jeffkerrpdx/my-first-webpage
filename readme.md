# _My First Webpage_

#### By _**Jeff Kerr**_

#### _This is my very first webpage using HTML and CSS in a very simple way_

## HTML, CSS, GIT


## My first webpage is exactly what it sounds like. It is not complex,not interactive and not terribly advanced. It is simply some HTML code using some <h1> and <p> tags and not a whole lot else. 


## No special setup or installation required. Recommend using Google Chrome but it should work on any browser. 


## No Known Bugs


## This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
